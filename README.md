# Express Yourself

This is the repository for the Express Yourself assignment from The Iron Yard in Durham, NC.

This assignment was an exercise to get more familiar with using regular expressions. We were assigned three files of pre-built tests, and were tasked with building functions using RegEx which passed the provided tests.
